| 0. What's my name | [0-print_name.c](https://github.com/MikeBilbee/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/function_pointers/0-print_name.c) | A function that prints a name. |
| 1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done | [1-array_iterator.c](https://github.com/MikeBilbee/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/function_pointers/1-array_iterator.c) | A function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array. |
| 2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities | [2-int_index.c](https://github.com/MikeBilbee/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/function_pointers/2-int_index.c) | A function that searches for an integer. | 
| 3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at | [3-calc.h]() / [3-op_functions.c]() / [3-get_op_func.c]() / [3-main.c]() | Contains all the function prototypes and data structures used by the program. / Contains the 5 following functions: op_add: returns the sum of a and b, op_sub: returns the difference of a and b, op_mul: returns the product of a and b, op_div: returns the result of the division of a by b, op_mod: returns the remainder of the division of a by b. / A function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user. / Contains the main function. |
